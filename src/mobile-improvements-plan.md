# Mobile Improvements Plan

## Plan:
1. **Update `src/App.js`**:
   - Review the layout to ensure it is flexible and adapts to different screen sizes.
   - Ensure buttons and interactive elements are appropriately sized for touch interactions.

2. **Modify `src/App.css`**:
   - Add media queries to adjust styles for smaller screens, ensuring that elements stack correctly and are visually appealing on mobile devices.
   - Increase button sizes and padding to improve touch targets.
   - Adjust flexbox properties to ensure proper alignment and spacing of elements on mobile.

3. **Review `public/index.html`**:
   - The viewport settings are already correct, so no changes are needed here.

## Follow-Up Steps:
- Test the application on various mobile devices to ensure responsiveness and functionality.
- Make any additional adjustments based on testing feedback.
